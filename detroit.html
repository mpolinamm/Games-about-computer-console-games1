<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Detroit: Become Human is a 2018 adventure game developed by Quantic Dream. The plot follows three androids: Kara (Valorie Curry), who escapes her owner to explore her newfound sentience and protect a young girl; Connor (Bryan Dechart), whose job is to hunt down sentient androids; Markus (Jesse Williams), who devotes himself to releasing other androids from servitude. The player&#39;s choices affect the course and outcome of the story.</p>
<p>Detroit: Become Human is based on Quantic Dream&#39;s 2012 technology demonstration Kara, which also starred Curry. To research the setting, the developers visited Detroit, Michigan. Writer and director David Cage completed the script in over two years. An engine was built to complement the game and hundreds of actors were cast before shooting and animation. Philip Sheppard, Nima Fakhrara, and John Paesano served as composers for Kara, Connor, and Markus, respectively. It was released for the PlayStation 4 in May 2018, published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Quantic Dream released a port for Windows in December 2019.</p>

<p>Set in 2038, caretaker android Markus and his owner return home and alert the police of a suspected burglary. In confronting the perpetrator, Markus bypasses his programming, thereby becoming a deviant android with full autonomy and sentience, leading the police to shoot him at arrival. Markus awakes in a landfill of broken androids and, after escaping, discovers Jericho, a derelict freighter and safe haven for deviants. There, Markus rallies the others to fight for their rights. They perform several acts of civil disobedience, which catch the public&#39;s attention and get more androids to join. This may culminate with the FBI attacking Jericho depending on Connor&#39;s actions. If he survives, Markus and the others set up a final march to an android recycling centre, resulting in either a war breaking out or the president opening peace talks.</p>
<p>Police investigator android Connor is sent by the CyberLife corporation to assist Detroit Police Department Lieutenant Hank Anderson, an alcoholic who hates androids. In the course of their investigation into an outbreak of deviants, they either develop a bond or enmity, potentially resulting in Hank committing suicide. During his hunt for Markus&#39; group, Connor starts to deviate, but can also preserve his programming. He eventually locates Jericho, where he can become a deviant himself. If he defects, Connor infiltrates CyberLife Tower and attempts to convert all androids there into deviants. This will result in an altercation with another &quot;machine&quot; Connor model, Connor-60, who may have Hank hostage depending on if he is alive. This can result in either Hank, Connor, or Connor-60&#39;s death. If not, he attempts to snipe Markus during the final protest, but is stopped by a SWAT team or Hank. If peace is achieved, Connor can choose whether or not to shoot Markus during a speech.</p>

<p>Kara, a housekeeper android for Todd Williams and his daughter Alice, escapes with her after he attacks them, resulting in Kara becoming a deviant. The two travel across Detroit, intending to enter Canada, which has no specific laws involving androids and where they will be safe. Kara and Alice befriend another android named Luther along the way, who joins them on their journey. They seek the aid of an android sympathizer, who points them to Jericho to obtain passports. They may get caught up in the potential FBI attack on Jericho, which may result in Luther, Kara, and Alice&#39;s deaths. Kara also learns that Alice is in fact an android, replacing the daughter taken away by Todd&#39;s wife who left him due to his drug addiction. They can reach Canada by bus or boat, survive an android recycling centre in which Markus may attack if the player chooses to fight a war, or in either case die trying.</p>
